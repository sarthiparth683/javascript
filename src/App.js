      <img src=".\images\6.variables\Screenshot (55).png" alt="" /> <br />
      <p>
        <br />
        Scope refers to the part of the program where a variable can be
        accessed. Function scope means that a variable declared with var inside
        a function can be accessed from anywhere inside that function, as well
        as from any other function that is nested within it. Global scope means
        that a variable declared with var outside of any function can be
        accessed from anywhere in the program.
        <br />
        <br />
        Block scope means that a variable declared with let or const inside a
        block of code (such as a function body, if statement, or for loop) can
        only be accessed from inside that block. This helps to prevent
        accidental reassignment of variables and makes code more readable and
        maintainable.
        <br />
        <br />
        Reassignment refers to the ability to change the value of a variable
        after it has been declared. Variables declared with var and let can be
        reassigned, but variables declared with const cannot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hoisting is a mechanism in JavaScript that moves all variable
        declarations to the top of their scope. This means that variables
        declared with var and let can be accessed before they are declared, but
        variables declared with const cannot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Initialization refers to the process of assigning a value to a variable
        when it is declared. Variables declared with var and let can be
        initialized or not, but variables declared with const must be
        initialized.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      7. Data Types:- <br />
      JavaScript has seven primitive data types: <br />
      Number: A numeric value.
      <br />
      String: A sequence of characters.
      <br />
      Boolean: A logical value, either true or false.
      <br />
      Null: A special value that represents the absence of a value.
      <br />
      Undefined: A special value that represents a value that has not yet been
      assigned.
      <br />
      Bigint: An integer with arbitrary precision.
      <br />
      Symbol: A unique value that can be used to identify objects.
      <br />
      <br />
      Non-primitive data types
      <br />
      JavaScript also has a number of non-primitive data types, which are
      objects. The most common non-primitive data types are:
      <br />
      Array: An ordered collection of values.
      <br />
      Object: A collection of key-value pairs.
      <br />
      Function: A block of code that can be executed.
      <br />
      Date: A representation of a date and time.
      <br />

      8. Operators in JavaScript:-
      <br />
      <img src=".\images\8.operators\Screenshot (59).png" alt="" /> <br />
      There are 7 types of operators in JavaScript:
      <br />
      Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform arithmetic operations such as
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
      <br />
      Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.
      <br />
      Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values and return a Boolean
      value (true or false).
      <br />
      Logical Operators: Used to combine two or more Boolean values to produce a
      single Boolean value.
      <br />
      Ternary Operator: Used to provide a concise way to write conditional
      statements.
      <br />
      Type Operator: Used to check the data type of a value.
      <br />
      Bitwise Operators: Used to perform bit-level operations on values.
      <br />
      <br />
      9. Arrays and their methods...
      <br />

      10. Objects
      <br />
      <img src=".\images\10. Object\Screenshot (61).png" alt="" /> <br />
      11. Events:-onclick,mouse movements etc... <br />
      There are many different types of events in JavaScript, some of the most
      common include: <br /> <br />
      Mouse events: These events are fired when the user interacts with the
      mouse, such as clicking, moving, or hovering over an element. <br />
      Keyboard events: These events are fired when the user presses or releases
      a key on the keyboard. <br />
      Form events: These events are fired when the user interacts with a form
      element, such as submitting a form or entering data into a field. <br />
      Window events: These events are fired when something happens to the
      browser window, such as resizing or closing. <br />
      Document events: These events are fired when something happens to the HTML
      document, such as loading or unloading. <br /> <br />
      JavaScript can respond to events in two ways: <br />
      1.)Inline event handlers: These are functions that are assigned to the on
      attribute of an HTML element. For example, the following code assigns a
      function to the onclick event handler of a button:
      <br />
      <img src=".\images\11.Events\1.png" alt="" />
      <img src=".\images\11.Events\2.png" alt="" /> <br />
      2.)AddEventListener() method: <br />

      <img src=".\images\11.Events\4.png" alt="" />
      <img src=".\images\11.Events\5.png" alt="" />
      <br />
      12. DOM <br />
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML
      documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document
      structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes
      and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
      <br />
      <br />
      JavaScript is the most common programming language used to interact with
      the DOM. JavaScript can be used to:
      <br />
      <br />
      <div style={{ margin: 20 }} >
        <li>Add, remove, or modify HTML elements</li>
        <li>Change the style of HTML elements</li>
        <li>Get or set the content of HTML elements</li>
        <li>Respond to user events, such as clicks and mouse movements</li>
      </div>
      <br />
      <img src=".\images\12.DOM\Screenshot (68).png" alt="" />
    </div>
  );
}
